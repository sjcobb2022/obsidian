## Basic definition

Computer: A computer is a device that manupulates data in accordance wiht a liost of instrucitons 

What features do we normall expect?
- digital :: binary
- programmable
- a general purpose computer; more precisely a Turing-complete device

### Focus of module

- binary data 
- processors
- memory
- IO
- peripherals
- digital circuits. 

Harvard Architechture vs Princeton Architechture

VonNeumann = Princeton

Input, memory output, control unit, ALU


Von Neuman most common models
- Does nto depend on the problem to be solved,; the solution of any problem requjire a program that needs to be entereed into the mmeory
- data and program shrae memory
- at least the following instructions supported (AND, OR, NOT, EQUAL) jumps wall interrupss
