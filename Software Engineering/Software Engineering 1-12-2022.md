# Stakeholders

## Generic stakeholder problems

- don't know what they really need
- lack of common engineering vocab
- conflicts between stakeholders are inevitable
- organisation and political factors may influence rational decision taking
- change will happen

Create compromise system so that everyone happy enough that it is a completed software.

## Feasibility study overview

- A feasibility study decides whether or not the proposed system is worthwhile (go/no go)
- Determines obvious constraints, facts and assumptions
- A short focused study that checks
	- contribution
	- engineering and budget
	- integration.

## Feasibility study implementation

- Produces a short report
- Explores the risk association with potential project
- Potential questions
	- what if the system wasn't implement
	- what are the current process problems
	- how will the proposed system help
	- what will be integration problems
	- is new technology needed? What skills are needed?
	- What facilities bust be supported by the system.
- Should not get bogged down in implementation details
