### GDPR

- Ability to remove mistakes (social media posts for example)



Issue 1: **Inferred Data**
- age/address is GDPR protected
	- company deside anyone over 84 is old
	- and your address is in kegworth
	- this is called profiling
- Fact that you are 'old and in kegworth'

Issue 2: **Hidden Information**
- Receive spam from a comapny that implies they know things about you.
- GDPR protection allows you to ask the company where the got the information
- Due to loophole they can tell you general terms such as "government" or "agency"



#### What happened when GDPR was introduced

- Did we retake ownership of our data?
	- not exactly
		- all websites ask for permission
		- removed from lots of span
- What happened with Brexit
	- GDRP remained in force during transition. Issued 'adequacy'

- Access of intofrmation abuot certain public bodies
	- publication scheme
	- general right of access
	- extends the DPA 2018
	- approx 50k applications a year
	- max fine 500,000
	- America got this in 1966
	- France makes us look efficient. (bad at processing queries)

#### General right of access
- to be told whether info exists
- to receive the information
- decision withhold requires good reason
- all requests must be sent in permanent form
	- email, letter, fax
- reply must be sent within 20 working days

#### FOI Exemptions

- Commercial Interest
- Excessive costs
- Communications with the King
- Law enforcement / Legal Professional Privilege
- Parliamentary Privilege

- Need to Apply Tests before using Qualified Exemptions:
	- Public Interests (not same as Interest to the Public)

#### FOI - Vexatious or Repeated 

- Vexatious
	- clearly does not have serious purpose or value
	- designed to cause disruption or annoyance
	- has the effect of harassing public authority
	- can otherwise be fairly characterised as obsessive or manifestly unreasonable
- Repeated means:
	- More often than a "reasonable interval"
	- Requests asking if previously requested information has changed are OK

### Implications for developers
- Those in control need a better overview of what is stored
- Development of dedicated FOI systems (NHS etc.)
	- Need for better retention of information
	- Audit trail support to show how changed, what, and when
	- To halt imminent deletion on acceptance of a request (government files often have a default deletion time)


**Don't ignore the law!!!!!**
