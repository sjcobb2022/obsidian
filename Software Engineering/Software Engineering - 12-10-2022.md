# Software Processes cont.

Every company implements their own systems. can be amallgamation or transformation of many different processes.

IBM 
 - RUM: Rational Unified Management

Branded iterative models

Iteration can be used in things such as UI design


## Intergration and configuration
- Based on sogtware reuse where systesm are interagrated from existing components or application systems (COTS Commercial-off-the-shelf systems)
- Reusse elements are configured/adapted
- Reuse is now cery common
	- Sharepoint, SAP solutions etc are all COTS

Most software is just commercial that is intergrated.

### Types of Reusable software
- Stand-alone application systems (solmetimes COTS) that are configired for us in a particular environment
- Web services that are developed according to service standards which are available for remote invocation
- Collections of objects that are dfeveloped as a package to been intergraed with a component framework such as .NET or J2EE


### Advantages and disadvantages. 
- reduced costs
- faster delivery
- requiremtn compromises are inveitable
- loss of control over evolution or reused sustem elements.


## Software evolution
- The world changes --> Software changes
- Software should be inherently flexible and suiport change
- Although ther has been a demarcation between this development and evolution (maintenance), this is increasingly irrelevant as fewer and fwerer sysyems are completely new.



## Software prototyping

- A protittype is an intial version of a system used to demonstrate concepts and try out design options
- A prototype can be used in:
	- The requirements engineering process to help with requirements elicitation and validation
	- In design processes to explore options and develop a UI design
	- Range from Low Fidelity to High Fidelity.



## KEY POINTS

- There are many approcahes to sogtware development
- Use depends on project context
- Change and evolution have to be planned for.


# Requirements Engineering

- Definition
- Documentaiton
- Mangement Processes
- Tools



## What are requirements
- The process of establishign the sustem requiremd bu the user
	- High level abstract, statements, lower level, techincal detail, system contraints, detailed mathemantical, functional, specs
- Why so broad an area?
	- They may be written for / by the users, developers, managers
	- They may be used as the basis for a buf for a contract. Therefore must be open to interpretation
	- May be the basis for a contract - therefore must be defined in detail.

#### Key Terms
- not pre-defined
- different wats of meeting the client organisation's needs
- validate

#### Good Requiremnts are

Feasible
Tracable
Unambiguous
Consistent
Necessary
Complete
Cost Effective
Verifiable

### Specifying written requiremnts

Ensure standard formatting

#### Description

- Short statements of purpose
	- The system will provide a print facility
- Try to avoid conflation here...

#### Identifier / ID
- Unique
- Normally Numberical
- Commonly uses sub-numbering to provide a secondart indicaor of requirement linkages
