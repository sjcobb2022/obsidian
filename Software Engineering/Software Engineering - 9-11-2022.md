# DevOps cont.

## Docker

- Released 2014
- software developed in environment heavily configured for software
- container based technology
- enables continuous integration & deployment by:
	- Adding a container to isolate the application from the underlying environment. Enables fast transfer between environments
	- choose OS image, configure Docker container to support your needs and add the application.

## Chef

- Enterprise development platform
	- convers both development and operation
- Monitoring through dashboards the state of:
	- Your development in terms of your teams, what code your submitting & when
	- Your deployed solutions computing nodes
		- Automating simple problem solving

## DevOps Drawbacks

- Requires change to organisational culture
	- A lot more open with data
	- Management, employee training
	- different types of trust/contracting
- Requires significant investment in software development tools
- Chef/other devops things is expensive!
- Currently very few academic studies exist to measure the effectiveness of DevOps

Thinks agile systems will generally go to DevOps eventually.

## Summary
- Provides fast scaling, modifiable.


# Introduction to Object Orientation and UML

## History
- Peaple are used to interacting wth objects
- Simula original
- C++ successful

### The Paradigm
- Identify objects
- group related information about an object together
- separation of structure from instantiation of an instance that structure.
- characteristics / data it holds.

### What do Objects specify
- objects should
	- store info internally
	- process information
		- getName()
		- setName()
	- Communicate information with other objects
	- OO languages objects = classes

**Animal &rarr; Dog &rarr; Terrier**

### Abstraction

- put stuff in italics that are parents.
- So many legs

### Overriding
- MaxLegs = 100
- Dog level : maxLevel = 4

### Methods
- setLegs()

### TL;DR Object oriented is bad and stinky

#### OOP Makes code re-use simpler

- Arianne 5 used ADA an OO lang.
- STACK OVERFLOW!!!!!!
- Depended on hardware failure: 


## Intro to UML

- Unified modelling language
	- a standardised general purpose modelling language designed for the field software engineering
	- object management group
- A bunch of lines and shapes

### What do we mean by visual notations

- Abstract shapes used to represent thing or actions from the real world
- The diagrams produced follows rules/standards

- No one has been trained on some things which can cause issues if they misinterpret symbols

### Why are they useful

- We can use a set of diagrams to describe different aspects of system
	- different levels of abstraction
	- examine aspects in detail
	- different perspectives on the same system
	- model views of system
		- user requirements, data flow, activities, sequences, physical equipment.

Lots of different notations

## NOT REALLY UNIFIED LOL!!!

### What we're gonna cover

- Class diagrams
- Object diagrams
- Activity diagram
- use-case diagram
- state-machine diagram
- sequence diagrams

### What is the point?

- Convenient abstraction
- help clarify one's own understanding
- they are useful to show for discussion/debate
- provide high level documentation
- Should be clear, simple, unambiguous.
	- UML defines rules
	- UML rules allow significant flexibility but this can be dangerous.

UML diagrams are completed to necessary level of ambiguity for whatever development that you are doing.
