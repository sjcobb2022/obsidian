## Intro to SE

#### What is Software Engineering
 - Software Engineering is concerned with theories, methods, and tools for professional software development
 - Good software engineering involves cost-effective softweare development
	 - The software cost often exceeds that of the hardware
	 - Maintenance costs for complex systems likely to be higher than original development
	 - Every system needs to consider dependability
		 - how usable how reliable does the software have to be
			 - how cheap can you make that software given these constraints

#### Why are you sat here
-  Ecenmoives of al develop nations are dependent on software
- parciically all sustems are software controlled
- IT expenditure = 3.7T
- Enterprise software 456billion
- 15.7% of projects are spend on research engineering
- 60% of all errors originate in the requirements process.

##### Complexity issues (everything is compartmentalised)
- Many mistakes weere caused by fixation on only software
	- Software lives in an envosustem
		- hardware 
		- software 
		- people 
		- process 
		- management 
- Out module is abuot sofrware but will consider it in the context of the wider socio-technical system

- Systems should be developed using an appropriate managed and understood development oprocess
	- software specifgication, where cujstomers and engineers degfine the sofware that is to be produced
	- Software developme where the sogware si designed and programmed. 
	- Software validation where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requjires
	- software evolution where the sofware is modified to ereflect changing customer and market requirements.


### Where does our software come from
- Bespoke development
	- Dewvelop from scratch, could be embedded
		- Decided what requirements are necessary
		- ensuring you get them
	- Could be truicky to maintain and risky to develop within a set timeframe and cost
- COTS (Commercuial Off The Shelf) developments
	- RElies on standard products
		- Deciding what requirements are necessary
		- More focus on where to compromuse needs or extend existing systems
	- Has it's own drawbacks
- In Reality, practically every ssystem us becoming a hybrid it some extent due to reuse of common components
	- Independence hnas become a concern in many systems


#### Case study: Tank thing
- 25 years of development hell
- stakeholders couldn't make their mind up
- Stupid situation of changing requirments 


#### Compormise affect teamp composition too
 - A manager ot team leader's job is to create a cohesive group and organize their group effectively.
 - May not be possible to appoint the idea people to work on a project

#### Naive Managers oput faith in fixed cost contracts
-  in any system where requiremtens are likely to change, for examopple, a new type of system, a fixed cost contract is likely tofail due to changes invalidating the oringal contract

#### Failure Case Study: Chinuke Helicopters
 - Process for precurement is an issue.

### Why is software different


### Trends


### StakeHolders


## Initial Case Studies
