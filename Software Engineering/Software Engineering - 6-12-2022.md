# Software Engineering Investigation Techniques

External organisation or internal team -> talk to end users and don't waste their time.

- Get specific information out of these people


## Role of documentation

- Much of what you need will always be in the docs
- different between docs and the way people work can tell you a lot
- Works best with system evolution rather than new system development
- Can look at the previous trail of the existing system, it can help you develop the new system
- Documentation tells the official side of the story...

## Team work: brain storming 

- "Ideas disappear faster than water evaporates unless written down"
- Focuses on imagination 
- 90% will be useless but 10% may be worthwhile
- breaks the ice

- UML use case diagrams are abstract enough to use in brainstorming

## Interviewing

- Formal or informal interviewing, the team puts questions to stakeholders about the system that they use and the system to be developed
- Want the stakeholder to trust you
- Two types of questions
	- closed
	- open
	- use both 
- Only record audio if you really need

They do not understand your motivations.


### Effective Interviewers

- Should be open minded, willing to listen
- Don't have preconceived ideas of how system should work
- worst question: "What do you want?"

- Should not be combative!

### Tips for interviews

- Leon system.
- If alone with an interviewee ensure that you are in public place, don't take abuse, take comfort breaks.
	- Documentation trail: Risk Assessment
- Ensure the interviewee knows their rights
- Informed consent: should have writing that they agree to take part.
- In Lboro these need to be checked by a committee


## Personas

- In security we use Bob, Alice, Sue and Mallory (the Evil one)
- most companies are more imaginative than that...
- Personas are used to represent the interests of user groups without identifying with real world individuals
	- Particularly useful when exploring negative character traits.

### Ethnography 

- Ethnography is sociotechnical technique embodying: People, Process, and Technology
- Observation - generates empirical data
- In its strict form provides recommendations only

- Useful for documenting the rich complexity of systems in operation.

Drawbacks:
- Expensive


- Studies can take hours, days, weeks,
- Those observed rarely have to explain or articulate their work
	- Thought there may be follow up interviews
- Unobtrusive behaviour vital!
	- Hawthorne bias
- Social, cultural, organisation factors of importance may be observed
- Reports released to management are anonymous

- Greenfield vs Brownfield 


## Think Aloud

Complete tasks while giving a verbal explanation

- Two Types
	- Concurrent
		- give verbal explanation as they go along
			- Issue: people get stressed by multi-tasking and may change their behaviour
	- Retrospective
		- record user and get them to overlay verbal explanation afterwards
			- Issue: People may miss bits out. 

More focused discussion on a given process.

## Written Communications

- Without the facial cues/voice inflections of f2f methods.
- People fill in the tone with the mood they are currently in
- Unfortunately damage is often not clear.
- Always end on a freindly note even if its just thankyou
- Lots of niceties!!!
- You will get lots of practice at this Team projects next year.



# Ethics & the Law

Chapter 1 of the course textbook

ACM software engineering code

## Background

- Software engineering involves wider responsibilities
- Software engineers must behave honestly and ethically

### Confidentiality
- Engineers should normally respect the confidentiality of their employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.

### Competence
- Engineers should not misinterpret their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is outwith their competence.

### Intellectual property rights
- Engineers should be aware of local laws governing the use of intellectual property such as patents.

### Computer misuse
- Software engineers should no use their technical skills to misuse the other people's computers. Computer misuse ranges from trivial (using another login) to catastrophic.

### ACM/IEEE code of ethics 

- Public
	- shall act consistently with the public interest
- Client and employer
	- act in a manner best for their client and employer in accordance to public interest
- Product
	- ensure product and modifications meet highest standards possible
- Judgement
	- maintain integrity and independence of their professional judgement
- Management
	- managers and leaders shall promote ethical approach
- Profession
	- shall advance integrity and reputation of the profession
- Colleagues
	- shall be fair and supportive of their colleagues
- Self
	- lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession shall promote ethical approach
