# Logic For Computer Science - 1

Focus in this class

dont do too little to late

## Central Questions of Logic
- how can we formalize statements?
- how can we combine them?
- how can we derive proofs from this?

Intersection of philosophy, maths and computer science. 

How do we define inifinity?

Logic is the calculus of computer science.

Logic is maths to reason abbout maths 

E.G. Hardware archutecture, network protocols, semantics/logic programming

Is the a finite set of elements

Is the inverse of a finite set defined over an infinte set e.g. the natural numbers an infinite set? or is that a misconception that i have .

is the cardinality of the inverse of a finite defined over a inifinte set infinite?


$$S = \{1,2,3,4\}$$

$$|\bar{S}|=\infty ??$$

If this isn't true...

$$|\bar{S} \cap \mathbb{N}| = \infty$$
$$\bar{S} \cap \mathbb{N} = \mathbb{N} - S ???$$

- SELF LOOPS CAN APPEAR IN TRANSITIVE WHEN THERE IS A CYCLE.
